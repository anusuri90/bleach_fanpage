        <h3>Ichigo Kurosaki</h3>
        <p>Ichigo is the orange-haired teenager turned reluctant hero, who unexpectedly inherits Soul Reaper powers from Rukia Kuchiki during a Hollow attack. A natural protector, he balances high academic performance with fierce loyalty and a short temper. Ichigo’s Zanpakutō, Zangetsu, evolves into a formidable Bankai—Tensa Zangetsu—allowing him unimaginable speed and power. Despite his tough exterior, he is compassionate and deeply committed to defending friends, family, and innocents. Underneath his scowl lies a courageous, determined spirit driven by personal loss and a growing sense of purpose. Wikipedia +15 Animepedia +15 Reddit +15</p>

Over time, she gains the Shun Shun Rikka, a unique set of healing and defensive powers capable of reversing injuries and nullifying attacks. Her emotional evolution, from school‑girl crush to courageous warrior, adds depth to her role and underlines her inner strength and empathy. CBR.</p>

As a member of the noble Kuchiki household, she embodies formality and restraint, yet her loyalty to Ichigo highlights her strength of character. Her ice‑based Zanpakutō, Sode no Shirayuki, is renowned for its elegance and strategic versatility in combat. Rukia is both mentor and moral anchor to Ichigo, motivating him toward his destiny
